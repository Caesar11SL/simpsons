# The Simpsons' character catalog


Live link via heroku: 

## Project description 
This is my attempt at my first fully functional CRUD application. A CRUD applications constist of four operations; CREATE, READ, UPDATE and DELETE.
These operations are used to interact with the http by using protocols. This program allows users to add new characters to their very own catalog. Users can read/update/delete the character of their choosing. As well as favoriting certain characters of their choosing. This is based on The Simpsons, hope y'all enjoy. I do not own any of these photos, only using them for edicationsl purposes.  
## User Stories 
 
### MVP
 -Users have the ability to add,view, update or delete characters into their catalog.
 
 -Each character will have buttons to view/edit/delete/favorite.
 
 -Users have the ability to add photos/GIFs for a certain character.
 
 -User will have a favorites page to see all their favorited characters.
 
 -Using EJS as templeting engine to render pages.
  
### Strech Goals

 -creating a search bar to seach up indivdual or multiple characters
 
 -refactor code for DOM manipulation
 
 -ability to filter characters in gallery
